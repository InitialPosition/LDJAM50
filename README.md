# Quackenfarm

Quackenfarm is my entry for the [**LDJAM50**](https://ldjam.com/) game jam and was designed and programmed in 48 hours. It is a round based gardening simulator where you have to plan ahead to be able to pay your ever increasing rent.

Think of it as Stardew Valley but with Chess.

The LDJAM website for this game can be found [**here**](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/50/quackenfarm).
